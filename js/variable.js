// all we need to declare a varibale is the keyworkd 'var' and an identifier.


// foo is declared bc it has var and an identifier but it is not defined.
var foo;
console.log("foo is " + foo);

//bar is declared and it's defined.
var bar = 3;
console.log("bar is " + bar);

// an error pops up saying that its undefined but that is wrong it actually means that is not declared. It doesn't excist anywhere in the program
console.log("name is " + name);
